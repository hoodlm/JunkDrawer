    <h3>What should I wear?</h3>

    <p>
    First of all - something warm! Weather permitting, parts of
    the wedding will be held outdoors.
    </p><p>
    Otherwise - wear whatever makes you feel great and ready to
    celebrate. Our wedding will be a fusion of Indian and
    Western traditions. Feel free to wear a suit or a kurta,
    a dress or a sari.
    </p><p>
    Please bring some color to the wedding! No one
    should come wearing black and white. Our decor and colors
    will be fall themed; here are some colors to consider:
    </p>

    <div id="colorbox" style="background-color:#01796f; color:white;">Pine Green</div><div id="colorbox" style="background-color:#92000a; color:white;">Sangria</div><div id="colorbox" style="background-color:#FF2400; color:white;">Scarlet</div><div id="colorbox" style="background-color:#6f4e37; color:white;">Coffee</div><div id="colorbox" style="background-color:#ff7518; color:white;">Pumpkin</div><div id="colorbox" style="background-color:#DAA520; color:black;">Goldenrod</div><div id="colorbox" style="background-color:#003366; color:white;">Midnight Blue</div><div id="colorbox" style="background-color:#4A8043; color:white;">Chameleon</div><div id="colorbox" style="background-color:#C0C0C0; color:black;">Silver</div>

    <h3>The Sangeet</h3>
    <p>
    Sangeet is an Indian tradition we are incorporating into our
    celebration. This would normally be held on the day before
    the main wedding ceremony, but we are combining it with the
    wedding reception.
    </p><p>
    To kick off the reception, we are looking to YOU to entertain
    us with your talents - in the form of dance, karaoke, poetry,
    or any other kind of performance art. This is entirely
    optional, but if you want to participate let us know what
    you have in mind, and we'll work with you on the logistics!

    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>
    Logan and Apeksha first met in a coffee shop in January 2019.
    We quickly bonded over a passion for good homecooked food,
    especially after a good hike.
    </p><p>
    During the pandemic, our passions deepened and we grew closer
    together - continuing to cook, brewing homemade craft beer
    and fruit (non-grape!) wine, watching the entire Marvel movie catalog,
    building our board game collection, and exploring the trails of Virginia
    and Maryland with our dog Zebra.
    </p><p>
    In September 2021, when we decided to get married,
    we also bought a heavy cast-iron wok. We don't keep it in a drawer or
    cabinet - partly because it's too big to fit in one - but also because
    we use it so much; it's almost always present out in the open on the stovetop.
    </p>
    <img src="./03.JPG" style="width:33%;margin-left:33%"/>
    <p>
    Much like our marriage, with the right care and maintenance,
    we expect our "engagement wok" to last the rest of our lives - and
    provide many good, warm homemade family dinners along the way!
    </p>
    <p>
    We would like to invite our family and friends to be a part
    of our journey as we embark on the next phase of our love story.
    <br/>
    We can't wait to see you in November!
    </p>
